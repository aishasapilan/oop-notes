Algorithm and Flowchart

Algorithm in programming
1. Problem Definiton - what is to be done?
2. Data Collection - what do we do to solve the problem?
3. Data Processing - understanding what we have or transforming them into a usable form
4. Logical Approach - employing the collected and created data against logic to solve
5. Solution - present the solution in the way you want in a GUI or terminal
